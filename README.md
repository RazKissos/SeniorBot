# SeniorBot by Raz Kissos.
# v1.0.0 released at 6/13/2020.
# A python Discord bot using the discord.py module.

This was my first shot at creating a full discord bot.
I implemented some basic functions (bitcoin value, 8ball, etc...) and something
of a 'friend system', you can add and remove friends, invite them to play etc...
