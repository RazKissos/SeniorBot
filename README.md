This was my first shot at creating a full discord bot.
I implemented some basic functions (bitcoin value, 8ball, etc...) and something
of a 'friend system', you can add and remove friends, invite them to play etc...

**If you wish to use it all you need is to create a config file named `botconfig.cfg` and paste your bot info like this:**
```
[data]
token = **<your bot token>**
prefix = **<your bot prefix>**
```
**and place the config file in the folder you run your bot file in.**
