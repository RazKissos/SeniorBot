# SeniorBot by Raz Kissos.
# v1.0.0 released at 6/13/2020.
# A python Discord bot using the discord.py module.

This was my first shot at creating a full discord bot.
I implemented some basic functions (bitcoin value, 8ball, etc...) and something
of a 'friend system', you can add and remove friends, invite them to play etc...

**If you wish to use it all you need is to create an empty json file named `userfriends.json` And a config file named `botconfig.cfg` and paste yout bot info like this:**
```config
[data]
token = **<your bot token>**
prefix = **<your bot prefix>**
```
**and place both files in the file you run your file in.**
