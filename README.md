# SeniorBot by Raz Kissos.
# v1.0.0 released at 6/13/2020.
# A Discord bot made using the discord.py python module.

This was my first shot at creating a full discord bot.
I implemented some basic functions (bitcoin value, 8ball, etc...) and something
of a 'friend system', you can add and remove friends, invite them to play etc...
The bot is usually offline so do not expect 24/7 usage.

**You can add SeniorBot to your server via this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=710077618493587539&scope=bot&permissions=8**

**If you wish to use it all you need is to create a config file named `botconfig.cfg` and paste your bot info like this:**
```
[data]
token = **<your bot token>**
prefix = **<your bot prefix>**
```
**and place the config file in the folder you run your bot file in. Also make sure you `pip install` each and every module used in the code to avoid errors!**
